    <section>
        <h2>Feature Details</h2>
        <h3>Single / Multi-Node Supply Chain Replenishment Planning</h3>
        <p>This capability covers both single-node and multi-node network configurations. For single-node networks, targeted strategies optimize inventory management and ensure timely replenishment, enhancing overall efficiency with minimal complexity. For more intricate multi-node networks, the approach involves sophisticated coordination and analytics to manage interdependencies effectively.</p>
        <h3>Advanced Reinforcement Learning Algorithms to Optimize Replenishment Planning</h3>
        <p>The deployment of advanced artificial intelligence models to optimize supply chain operations includes the use of the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) model for simpler supply chains. This model is renowned for its efficiency and straightforward application, proving effective in environments with predictable outcomes. It optimizes inventory levels through precise value function estimation and ensures process stability using techniques such as experience replay and fixed Q-targets.</p>
        <p>For more complex, multi-node supply chain networks, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model is utilized. PPO effectively navigates the complexities of intricate systems, optimizing policies directly to adapt flexibly to dynamic conditions. Its incremental and safe policy adjustments provide the robustness needed to effectively manage the uncertainties of supply and demand.</p>
        <h3>Integrated Forecasting</h3>
        <p>The integrated advanced forecasting capabilities combine the best of both worlds: cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and proven classical statistical methods. This hybrid approach harnesses the predictive power of machine learning, including deep learning models that adapt and learn from vast data sets, alongside time-tested statistical algorithms that provide stability and reliability in forecast accuracy.</p>
